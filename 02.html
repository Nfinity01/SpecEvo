  The evolution of organisms in the Earth's future is a popular subset of speculative evolution. A relatively common theme in future evolution is civilizational collapse and/or humans becoming extinct due to an anthropogenic extinction event caused by environmental degradation. After such a mass extinction event, the remaining non-human fauna and flora evolve into a variety of new forms.Ideas of future evolution are also frequently explored in science fiction novels, such as in Kurt Vonnegut's 1985 science fiction novel Galápagos, which imagines the evolution of a small surviving group of humans into a sea lion-like species. Stephen Baxter's 2002 science fiction novel Evolution follows 565 million years of human evolution, from shrewlike mammals 65 million years in the past to the ultimate fate of humanity (and its descendants, both biological and non-biological) 500 million years in the future. C. M. Kosemen's 2008 All Tomorrows similarly explores the future evolution of humanity. Speculative biology and the future evolution of the human species are significant in bio art. Although the foundations of this subset were laid by Wells's The Time Machine already in 1895, it is generally agreed to have been definitely founded through Dixon's After Man in 1981, which explored a fully realized future ecosystem set 50 million years from the present. Dixon's third work on speculative evolution, Man After Man (1990) is also an example of future evolution, this time exploring an imagined future evolutionary path of humanity.

        Speculative evolution is a genre of speculative fiction and an artistic movement focused on hypothetical scenarios in the evolution of life, and a significant form of fictional biology. It is also known as speculative biology and it is referred to as speculative zoology in regards to hypothetical animals. Works incorporating speculative evolution may have entirely conceptual species that evolve on a planet other than Earth, or they may be an alternate history focused on an alternate evolution of life. Speculative evolution is often considered hard science fiction because of its strong connection to and basis in science, particularly biology.

        The website functions like a fandom wiki. All information regarding speculative evolution is made available to the public. Users can also post their own speculations. The website is open to all ideas. However full access (articles,books etc.) can only be given to members. Anyone can become a member at a price of $1. Members can edit pages and can even get the chance to talk to pioneers of speculative evolution like Nemo ramjet, Dougal dixon etc. Reasearch and articles related to the topic are also posted. The website is made for public knowledge only.
